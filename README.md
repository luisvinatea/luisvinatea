## 👋 About Me

I’m an Economist turned Data & Business Intelligence Analyst with over 5 years of experience in financial analysis, process automation, and data visualization. My expertise lies in leveraging **Python**, **SQL**, **R**, **Power BI**, and **Tableau** to deliver actionable insights and optimize business performance. With a Master’s in Corporate Finance (2025, OBS Business School) and a proven track record in financial modeling, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into strategic solutions that drive cost savings, revenue growth, and operational efficiency.

Throughout my career, I’ve implemented data-driven strategies that reduced operational costs by up to 30%, increased conversion rates by 200%, and generated over 1 million BRL in revenue. I thrive in multicultural environments, bringing fluency in three languages and international experience to the table.
